Used for detecting cycle in undirected graph


undirected and unconnected graph
s1 = {1,2,3,4}
s2 = {5,6,7,8}
s1 intersection s2 = Ï†

find operation:
5 is in s1 => find(5) = s2

s1 union s2 = {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8}

find u and v: find(u) != find(v) => connecting u and v will union the two sets

if find(u) == find(v) => u and v are already connected => cycle
