Identification:
	1. k is given
	2. smallest/largest is given

Types:
	1. min heap:
		kth largest
	2. max heap:
		kth smallest

Questions based on sorting 
We make a heap of size k and order nlogn is reduced to nlogk


Max heap will ensure that the top element will always be maximum. It doesn't
say that heap will always be sorted

Similarly top of min heap will always be smallest number.
