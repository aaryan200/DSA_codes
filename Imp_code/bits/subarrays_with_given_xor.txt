Target xor = k

arr[i,i] is also considered a subarray.

Prefix array:
prefix[0]=0;
prefix[i]=(arr[0]^arr[1]^...^arr[i-1]) for all i>=1

Let answer = 0
map m from xor value to frequency of its occurence in prefix array.

Let prefix[i]=y
Let prefix[j+1]=x
=> if xor sum of arr[i,j] (i.e. arr[i]^arr[i+1]...^arr[j]) is equal to k, then x = y^k
=> We know how many times xor sum x has appeared in xorarr till now
=> If you add number of times x has appeared in xorarr till now, then that will be the number of subarrays ending at j and starting at i<j. => answer+=m[x]
Now, if y==k (i.e. xor sum of arr[j,j] is equal to k) then add it to answer => answer++;
Now, m[y]++;
